* JavaScript Package Management Powered  by Nix
floco is a bold departure from conventional Node.js package management tooling focusing on reproducibility, distributed caching, and sandboxing.

* Why?
** 3 Column with Images
*** Control
Floco provides users with full control over build, resolution, node_modules/ tree shape, and dependency versions, including the ability to declare custom install strategies.

*** Speed
Barebones installers written in coreutils run with significantly reduced overhead.
Unrivaled caching allows you to build packages once and reuse them on compatible systems.

*** Transparency
Floco's Virtualized Package Registry gives you explicit control over available modules without a proxy server.
Sandboxed Builds are driven without network access, ensuring reproducibility and security.
