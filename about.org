=floco= is a Node.js package management and build tool powered by
[[https://nixos.org][Nix]].

=floco= is a bold departure from conventional Node.js package management tooling
focusing on reproducibility, distributed caching, and sandboxing.

Every package is built in a strictly declared sandbox isolated from the runtime
system, much like an /OCI/ container.
This approach allows packages to be built once and reused on any system that
shares the same architecture and platform.
Artifacts are cached locally and may be distributed among a cluster of systems
allowing development environments to be created at more than twice the speed of
=npm= or =yarn=.

Underlying installers are implemented in =bash= and limit themselves to using
=coreutils=, =findutils=, and =jq= improving reproducibility and readability
compared to tooling implemented using a sprawling maze of JavaScript.
